# Recompiled rockchip-specific debian packages

These packages are intended for Rockchip SBCs like the Orange Pi 5. Licenses for each package are included in the package directory.

The package set is minimalistic, rebuilding only packages that are absolutely needed for full rockchip compatibility on Debian.
